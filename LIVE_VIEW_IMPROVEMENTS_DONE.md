## 🔧 Backend Changes

### Updated API Response:

**Before:**
```javascript
{
  auction, teams,
  soldPlayers: [...]  // Only sold players
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{
  auction, teams,
  players: [...]  // ALL players (sold, unsold, pending)
}
```

**Changes in getLiveViewData:**
- ✅ Returns all players (not just sold)
- ✅ Includes auctionStatus field
- ✅ Includes basePrice field
- ✅ Populates team data
- ✅ Sorted by playerNumber for search

## 💻 Frontend Changes

### New States:
```javascript
const [allPlayers, setAllPlayers] = useState([]);
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState('all');
const [teamFilter, setTeamFilter] = useState('all');
const [filteredPlayers, setFilteredPlayers] = useState([]);
```

### Filter Logic:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let filtered = allPlayers;
  
  // Search by name or number
  if (searchQuery) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(player => 
      player.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      player.playerNumber.toString().includes(searchQuery)
    );
  }
  
  // Filter by status
  if (statusFilter !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(player => player.auctionStatus === statusFilter);
  }
  
  // Filter by team
  if (teamFilter !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(player => {
      const playerTeamId = player.team?._id || player.team;
      return playerTeamId?.toString() === teamFilter;
    });
  }
  
  setFilteredPlayers(filtered);
}, [searchQuery, statusFilter, teamFilter, allPlayers]);
```

│ - Title + LIVE + Viewers               │
│ - Stats Row (5 cards)                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Current Bidding (Hero)
├─ Player Card | Bidding History

2-Column Grid:
├─ Leaderboard | Recent Sales

```

### Search Section:
